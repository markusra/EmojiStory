            This survey is created by Martin Kjellevand and Markus Rauhut for
            researching the <b>usability</b> and <b>security</b> of emoji-based
            authentication. The data from this survey is collected for a master
            thesis conducted at the{" "}
            <b>Norwegian University of Science and Technology</b>. The survey is
            divided into two parts. In order to be able to remind you about the
            second part, we ask you for an email address.
